# Snake Game (C / Raylib)

A grid-based Snake game developed as part of coursework and personal projects, focusing on deterministic game logic, collision detection, and timing-aware game loops.

## Features
- Grid-based snake movement
- Fruit spawning and scoring
- Collision detection with walls and self
- Smooth, timing-aware game loops

## Technologies
- C
- Raylib
- Git for version control

## Learning Outcomes
- Structured and maintainable coding
- Debugging and problem-solving skills
- Understanding of real-time game loops

## Portfolio Summary
This project demonstrates skills in low-level programming, real-time system logic, and problem decomposition. It reflects an ability to implement structured, maintainable, and deterministic code in a team or individual project environment.
